(This is the unintended)

Looking at the challenge, looking at the name Gaston La Paffe and taking the first letters of the words, we get "GLP".
Looking on the internet, we come across a single paper on this signature scheme, GLP, based on RLWE (which is also not
reccomended anymore today, and has been substitued by a variant called GLYPH). GLP works in a cyclotomic ring, in our case
all the operations are done in a polynomial quotient ring, Z_q[x]/(x^n+1). The polynomial quotient rings where the underlying structure
is a field (aka q is prime) are known as Euclidean rings, and in those rings is defined a division with remainder, and a multiplicative inverse.
Taking the first signature, we realise that z1 = s1*c + y1, meaning that s1 = (z1-y1) * c^-1. This way we get c1. Now, 
t = a * s1 + s2, meaning s2 = t - a * s1. Now we have both s1 and s2, time to decrypt ^^.
